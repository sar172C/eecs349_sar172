Question 1:

By following the address calls I was led to a JE call on line '00401243', which sets the jump to different
prompts depending on whether the name and serial number are a match. By changing this to a JNE
program passes by serial check without need for correct serial number.


Question 2:
In order to generate serial number from given name,
-add ASCII value of all characters in name
-xor that value with 0x5678
-xor resulting value with 0x1234

(meow becomes 17780)
(Ryan becomes 17782)
(Moose becomes 17871)
